# `biocmask`

`biocmask` provides efficient abstractions to the *SummarizedExperiment* such
that using common dplyr functions feels as natural to operating on a
*data.frame* or *tibble*. `biocmask` was built as an alternative to the 
`tidySummarizedExperiment` package but there may be a future in which their
conflicts are reconciled. `biocmask` uses 
[data-masking](https://rlang.r-lib.org/reference/topic-data-mask-programming.html) 
from the `rlang` package in order to connect dplyr functions to
*SummarizedExperiment* slots in a manner that aims to be intuitive and avoiding
ambiguity in outcomes.

***Note:***  This package is still under active development as of Fall 2024.

# data masking `SummarizedExperiment`

\
The `SummarizedExperiment` object contains three main components/"contexts" that we mask, 
the `assays()`, `rowData()`[^1] and `colData()`.

[^1]: At this moment `rowRanges()` is not supported in `biocmask` but may become
its own pronoun in the future.

\
`biocmask` provides variables as-is to data **within their current contexts** enabling you 
to call S4 methods on S4 objects with `dplyr` verbs. If you require access to
variables _outside the context_, you may use 
pronouns made available through `biocmask` to specify where to find those 
variables.

For each pronoun listed, there is an `_asis` variant that returns underlying data without reshaping it to fit the context.

\

The `.assays`, `.rows` and `.cols` pronouns outputs depends on the evaluating 
context. Users should expect that the underlying data returned from `.rows` or
`.cols` pronouns in the _**assays context**_ is a vector, replicated to match 
size of the assay context.
\
Alternatively, using a pronoun in either the `rows()` or `cols()` 
contexts will likely return a list equal in length to either `nrows(rowData())`
or `nrows(colData())`.
