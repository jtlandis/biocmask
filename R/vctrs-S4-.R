#' @title S7 classes for vctrs and S4 Vectors
#' @name vectors
#' @description
#' A set of S7 classes and Class unions that help establish S7 method dispatch.
#' These classes were made to re-export several `vctrs` functions such that
#' internals for `biocmask` were consistent with room for optimization.
#' @seealso [bioc_rep()],[bioc_recycle()],[bioc_slice()]
#' @return S7 class union or base class
#' @export
