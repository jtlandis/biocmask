vec_slice(x, i, ...)

\arguments{
\item{x}{A vector}

\item{i}{An integer, character or logical vector specifying the
locations or names of the observations to get/set. Specify
\code{TRUE} to index all elements (as in \code{x[]}), or \code{NULL}, \code{FALSE} or
\code{integer()} to index none (as in \code{x[NULL]}).}

\description{
This extends \code{vctrs::vec_slice} to \code{S4Vectors::Vector} class by masking
\code{vec_slice} with \code{S7::new_generic}. Atomic vectors and other base S3 classes
(list, data.frame, factor, Dat, POSIXct) will dispatch to the
\code{vctrs::vec_slice} method as normal. Dispatch support on the
\code{S4Vectors::Vector} and \code{S4Vectors::DataFrame} classes provides a unified
framework for working with base R vectors and \code{S4Vectors}.
\subsection{\code{S4Vectors::Vector} Implementation}{

This method will naively call the \code{[} method for any S4 class that inherits
from the \code{S4Vectors::Vector} class. This may not be a very efficient way to
slice up an S4 class, but will work.

With this implementation, the \code{x@mcol} data is expected to be retained after
a call to \code{biocmask::vec_slice(x, i)}.
}

\subsection{\code{S4Vectors::DataFrame} Implementation}{

The \code{DataFrame} implementation works similar to how \code{vctrs::vec_slice} works
on a \code{data.frame} object. What is being sliced is the rows of \code{x@listData}.
To maintain the size stability of the \code{DataFrame} object, we change \verb{@nrows}
to the appropriate value, and perform a recursive call if \verb{@elementMetadata}
is not \code{NULL}.
}

\subsection{Performance}{

Depending on the size and complexity of your S4 Vector object, you may find
the standard subset operation is extremely slow. For example, consider a
\code{SummarizedExperiment} whose rowData contains a \code{CompressedGRangesList}
object assigned to the name "exons" and whose length is 250,000 and
underlying \verb{@unlistData} is length 1,600,000. Performing a by \code{.features}
grouping operation and attempting to evaluate the \code{exons} within the row
context would force the \code{CompressedGRangesList} object to be
chopped element-wise.

Unfortunately, there is a massive performance hit in attempting to construct
250,000 \code{GRanges}. Unless you do not mind waiting over an hour for each
\code{dplyr} verb in which \code{exons} gets evaluated, consider \code{biocmask_s4_proxy_vec()}.
This attempts to reconstruct certain standard \code{S4Vectors::Vectors} as
standard vectors or tibbles. The equivalent \code{exons} object would require
much more memory use, but at the advantage of only taking several seconds to
construct.When you are done, you can attempt to restore the original S4
Vector with \code{biocmask_restore_s4_proxy()}.

\code{biocmask_s4_proxy_vec()} is faster to work with because there are less
checks on the object validity and all \verb{@elementMetadata} and \verb{@metadata} are
dropped from the objects.
